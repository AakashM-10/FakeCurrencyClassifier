# FakeCurrencyClassifier
# K-Nearest Neighbour Python
Classification of Fake and Genuine Currency notes using K- Nearest Neighbour in Python.

# About :
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. 

In other words, similar things are near to each other.

The KNN algorithm hinges on this assumption being true enough for the algorithm to be useful. KNN captures the idea of similarity (sometimes called distance, proximity, or closeness) with some mathematics we might have learned in our childhoodâ€” calculating the distance between points on a graph.
This project aims to classify currency notes as fake or genuine using KNN algorithm and gives the accuracy of the prediction made by KNN model.

# Dataset Description :
The dataset consists of  features include :

Variance of wavelet transformed images

Skewness of wavelet transformed images

Curtosis of wavelet transformed images

Entropy of images of both fake and genuine notes.
